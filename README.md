questions you might have:
1: what are all these images? screenshots. most of them. others as you'll see, snippets. they tell a visual story of some apps i've created. 
(i): qwetu was, is an android application designed for college students leaving school. some of them, most of them really, having camped in hostels for years, need assistance in the tumbling housing world. thats where our application comes in.
with 'qwetu', they can, browse through a sea of uploads from home owners, landlords and or sellers, communicate with them through direct messages and bids for property, pay, send sms's to their fellow tenants and hopefully, land on their feet.
the database is firebase, and the stk goes to mpesa. with qwetu, conent creators dont have to flunk your fyp with videos of milion dolar apartments cause they have a place for that now.
(ii): duka is also an android app but with key differences to qwetu. its for sellers and shoppers.
all of this app revolves around one key feature. automated payment. see, instead of copy pasting till numbers and memorizing paybills of different shops, with duka, you only need to add your mpesa pin while paying.
your favorite 'duka' goes into our app, adds their most prefered method of payment and when you browse for groceries and maybe pay, the amount and so set 'mode of payment' is automatically loaded.

2: what makes your apps stand out?
(i): they are for everyone. unlike glovo for people who only shop in glovo, duka is for your local mama mboga and your towny supermarket. everyone. qwetu too. this goes for everyone looking to rent or purchase property.

3: what makes you different?
(i): im not.
